# FillerWordsShock

Shock Collar for Presentation "Filler Words"

## Why

(No, not an actual schock collarðŸ™‚)

I've been speaking in public for about 40 years. I am always looking to improve my pace, clarity, informational value, and educational value. My new job, which I love, does not require as much public speaking as my old job and I am a little out of practice. I have noticed a few filler words creeping back into my presentations. Words such as "Um" and "Uh". 

I thought "Wouldn't it be great if, while I am presenting, an app was converting my spoken words to text real time and flagging filler words?" These flagged words would give me a little reminder to slow down and take more pauses, if needed.
